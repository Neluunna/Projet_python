I arrive and they do a bunch of tests and vitals and treat you like your just this broken thing they have to deal with.

In recent years, there has been a growing\ninterest in AI development and implementation in the region. This paper\npresents a ranking of Latin American (LATAM) countries based on their potential\nto become emerging powers in AI. The ranking is based on three pillars:\ninfrastructure, education, and finance. Infrastructure is measured by the\navailability of electricity, high-speed internet, the quality of\ntelecommunications networks, and the availability of supercomputers. Education\nis measured by the quality of education and the research status. Finance is\nmeasured by the cost of investments, history of investments, economic metrics,\nand current implementation of AI.\n  While Brazil, Chile, and Mexico have established themselves as major players\nin the AI industry in Latin America, our ranking demonstrates the new emerging\npowers in the region. According to the results, Argentina, Colombia, Uruguay,\nCosta Rica, and Ecuador are leading as new emerging powers in AI in Latin\nAmerica. These countries have strong education systems, well-developed\ninfrastructure, and growing financial resources. The ranking provides a useful\ntool for policymakers, investors, and businesses interested in AI development\nin Latin America. It can help to identify emerging LATAM countries with the\ngreatest potential for AI growth and success."", ""author"": [{""name"": ""Abraham Ramos Torres""}, {""name"": ""Laura N Montoya""}], ""arxiv:comment"": {""@xmlns:arxiv"": ""http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"", ""#text"": ""9 pages, 4 tables, 9 figures""}, ""link"": [{""@href"": ""http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09056v1"", ""@rel"": ""alternate"", ""@type"": ""text/html""}, {""@title"": ""pdf"", ""@href"": ""http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09056v1"", ""@rel"": ""related"", ""@type"": ""application/pdf""}], ""arxiv:primary_category"": {""@xmlns:arxiv"": ""http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"", ""@term"": ""econ.GN"", ""@scheme"": ""http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom""}, ""category"": [{""@term"": ""econ.GN"", ""@scheme"": ""http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom""}, {""@term"": ""q-fin.EC"", ""@scheme"": ""http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom""}, {""@term"": ""q-fin.RM"", ""@scheme"": ""http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom""}]}"	Arxiv

However, most\nof the research tradition, methods, and theories in the field follow a strong\ntrend grounded in social and cultural aspects from North America and Western\nEurope. Therefore, it is inevitable that some of the underlying, and\nestablished, knowledge in the field will not be directly transferrable or\napplicable to other populations. This paper presents the results of an\ninterview study conducted with Latin American faculty on the feasability,\nviability, and prospect of a curriculum proposal for CSCW Education in Latin\nAmerica: To this end, we conducted nine interviews with faculty currently based\nin six countries of the region, aiming to understand how a CSCW course targeted\nto undergraduate and/or graduate students in Latin America might be deployed.\nOur findings suggest that there are specific traits that need to be addressed\nin such a course, such as: tailoring foundational CSCW concepts to the\ndiversity of local cultures, motivating the involvement of students by tackling\nrelevant problems to their local communities, and revitalizing CSCW research\nand practice in the continent."", ""author"": [{""name"": ""Francisco J.
